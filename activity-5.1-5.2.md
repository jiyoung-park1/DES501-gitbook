**UI basic principles**

there are four kinds of interface elements: 

1. input controls
2. navigational components
3. informational components
4. containers

-input controls

Check boxes: check boxes usually present in a vertical list and allow the user to select options from a set. 

Radio buttons: it allows the users to choose only one between two options.

 Dropdown lists: dropdown lists are similar with radio buttons that allow only one thing to choose but are more compact. so you can save space. 

List boxes: list boxes allow the users to select a multiple items at a time.

Buttons: buttons indicate an action upon touch and they are usually presented by text, icon or both

#### Activity 5.2 <a id="yui_3_17_2_1_1589687112832_749"></a>

1. smart devices
2. mobile applications
3. screen and buttons on a parking meter
4. website

each one has a different screen size and type of users and their uses are different as well. For example, a mobile application is based on a small screen \(such as smart phone or tablet etc..\) compared to a website, and recently almost people have used smart phone instead of a cell phone. So, the importance of mobile applications have risen rapidly. they need to make touchable. 

on the other hand, users usually access a website using their mobile phone so it is totally different from a size of mobile applications. therefore, this fact makes user interface design different between  each medium.
