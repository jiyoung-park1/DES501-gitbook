 According to Xero, their system has many profits. First of all, they can import automate bank transaction and use coding suggestions to reconcile in just one click. As sqlsevices website has displayed, they have one of the largest commercial DBA and consulting service teams in New Zealand and Australia.

 I think I might categorise these services by sorting their clients whether they are a company or not. Through this criterion, Xero system might be for individuals but sql services for a company.

size and culture are two factors that play a significant part in the creation and structuring of any business. When it comes to those operating in the IT industry, there are numerous factors to take into account when deciding whether or not to have a division specialized in innovation. ‌ For a business to have specific roles focused on forward thinking and future proofing would affect the structure of a company in a few ways, namely by requiring a new individuals, teams or departments that are employed to develop these ideas and concepts for the company. This department would have to be in contact with upper management to present the concepts so the company can advance, but they could also serve as a middle man for employees to give their input to, rather than trying to pitch to bosses or CEO'S.‌ This would save time for all parties involved. ‌ Other factors that affect the culture and structure are dependent on the size of the business. This can affect the structure in a variety of ways, for example, smaller businesses would not find it as arduous to have an important round-table discussion between all members of the business, simply for the fact that it is easy to get everyone in the same room, under the same roof. For a larger business this would be a more challenging proposition and its why the middle-managers and various team leaders are required.

* business strategy - IT has drastically changed how a business strategizes, especially in the era where rudimentary AI and advances in machine learning cause significant changes in how information is processed and categorized. Business are more data driven now then ever before, and consequently user data is some of the most important to a business.

‌  


   organizational culture - IT has accelerated the speed of communication among the employees and managers. Therefore, many companies has chased faster responses and better outputs using information technologies such as cloud, direct messenger etc.

‌  


* Organisational structure -As IT has developed, organizational structure also has changed. Now companies no longer have to talk or discuss face-to-face conversations and this has contributed to the fact that organizational culture has become horizontal. And it has increased the efficiency of the work.

‌  


* Business processes - IT has changed numerous business processes, a key one among them being the move from paper and physical data to digital data and cloud-based information. Alongside this change has been the automation and streamlining of nearly every process imaginable, from payment systems to tracking metrics, collecting customer data, monitoring certain processes etc.

‌‌  


* The nature of work & the workplace - With all the advancements in modern technology, computers and tech, devices and automation have become more ingrained into our daily lives, especially in the workplace. From offices to shops, warehouses to factories, we're using technology a lot more frequently to help us with our tasks, or even fulfill some of the more manual labour roles that used to be done by hand.‌ The use of smart phones and online communication platforms can connect companies to teammates around the world, in different divisions of your company, to delegate work and share with each other in realtime. You can have conference calls on skype without even leaving your house. You can work at home by using remote access to your company's server. You could have a whole team collaborating together with each member being in a different location around the world - the employees don't even need to be in an office together anymore. Before tech took over this wasn't at all possible. Even in mundane places like supermarkets, roles that humans used to fill have been replaced with machines, the self checkouts. Another example would be the use of a service like Github in the workplace. Team members can all work on a repository together, from anywhere, and share their work with each other.‌ There are a lot of benefits for this integration, including that people can be infinitely more mobile. People can be comfortable in their own environments therefore keep their morale and productivity levels high. There is a lot less menial/manual tasks being carried out by workers, which can be automated by machines or AI instead. It can be easier to learn and solve problems with the internet and the expertise of people from different backgrounds and/or cultures around the world being at your fingertips.
